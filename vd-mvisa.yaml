  description: "MerchantPushPayments is used for payment to a merchant for goods or\
    \ services purchased, either face-to-face or remote ecommerce payment. This API\
    \ is invoked in the following sequence:&lt;br&gt;1.The consumer connects the account\
    \ through the mobile device, provides payment instructions and authenticates themselves.\
    \ The merchant information is captured by the consumers mobile from the merchant\
    \ information display which can be through key entry, QR code, NFC or other means.\
    \ The payment instructions include merchant ID (which is used to identify the\
    \ merchant PAN), the amount to be paid and optionally a payment reference such\
    \ as an invoice or bill number.&lt;br&gt;2. Upon receiving the payment instructions,\
    \ the consumers issuer invokes MerchantPushPayments POST operation to push payment\
    \ instructions to the merchants account.&lt;br&gt;3. The merchant acquirer processes\
    \ the Visa message, creates a record of merchant payment and reverts back with\
    \ a response message containing the MerchantPushPayments response attributes.&lt;br&gt;4.\
    \ On completion, both the consumer and the merchant receive confirmation or decline\
    \ notification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; If the POST call times out,\
    \ the resource will return a statusIdentifier which can be used in the MerchantPushPayments\
    \ Transactions GET operation as the statusIdentifier in the URL."
